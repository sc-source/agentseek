# Other Common Development Issues

A collection of standalone but high-frequency issues that span multiple categories or sit at the basic engineering layer.

## Issue 1: A tool needs to return extra data on top of the model-facing result

- **Symptom**: A tool needs to return both "text for the model to read" and "extra data for the application side to consume" — e.g. a retrieval tool needs to return a passage (for the model) and the source document ID + page number (for the frontend to highlight); an order lookup needs to return an order summary (for the model) and the full order object (for the next tool / main agent state). Concatenating everything into one string lets the model get distracted by irrelevant fields; returning only text loses the structured data.
- **Cause**: A tool's return value has three different semantics; mixing them causes problems:
  - For the **model** to see: must fit into `ToolMessage.content`; the model uses this to decide next steps.
  - For the **application layer / downstream business code** to see, but **not** into the LLM context: e.g. document ID, raw payload, render hints.
  - For writing back to **agent state**, to be read by subsequent tools / middleware: e.g. `customer_id`, `last_order`, `current_step`.

  These three categories should go through three different channels; jamming them into one string both adds noise for the model and loses structured data for the application.
- **Solution**: Choose the return style by data destination (three styles can be mixed):

  - **Model-only → return string or dict directly**: dicts get serialized into `ToolMessage.content`, and the model reads the fields itself.
  ```python
  from langchain.tools import tool

  @tool
  def get_weather_data(city: str) -> dict:
      """Get structured weather for a city."""
      return {"city": city, "temperature_c": 22, "conditions": "sunny"}
  ```

  - **One for the model + metadata for the app layer (not into LLM) → `ToolMessage(artifact=...)`**: `content` enters the model context, `artifact` doesn't enter the model but stays on the `ToolMessage` for downstream consumption (typical scenario: retrieval tool returning passage + document ID).
  ```python
  from langchain.messages import ToolMessage
  from langchain.tools import ToolRuntime, tool

  @tool
  def search_books(query: str, runtime: ToolRuntime) -> ToolMessage:
      """Retrieve a passage and attach source metadata."""
      passage = "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times."
      return ToolMessage(
          content=passage,                                  # enters model context
          tool_call_id=runtime.tool_call_id,
          name="search_books",
          artifact={"document_id": "doc_123", "page": 0},   # readable to app layer, not into LLM
      )
  ```
  Application code later reads structured data from `message.artifact`; the model sees only the `content` text.

  - **Write data back to agent state for subsequent tool / middleware / main agent reuse → return `Command(update=...)`**: in the update, place both business fields and a `ToolMessage` (must contain a ToolMessage paired with `tool_call_id`, otherwise the next LLM call will fail with invalid message sequence because "tool_call has no tool_response").
  ```python
  from langchain.messages import ToolMessage
  from langchain.tools import ToolRuntime, tool
  from langgraph.types import Command

  @tool
  def lookup_customer(customer_id: str, runtime: ToolRuntime) -> Command:
      """Look up customer and write profile into agent state."""
      profile = fetch_customer(customer_id)              # {"name": ..., "tier": ..., ...}
      return Command(update={
          "customer_profile": profile,                   # written into state, readable by subsequent tools
          "messages": [ToolMessage(
              content=f"Found customer {profile['name']} (tier: {profile['tier']})",
              tool_call_id=runtime.tool_call_id,         # required to pair with tool_call
          )],
      })
  ```
  State fields must first be declared in `state_schema` (or via an `AgentState` subclass), otherwise updates are ignored.

- **Lessons learned**:
  - Default to "return string/dict" — covers 80% of scenarios.
  - For fields the **application layer wants but would be noise in the LLM context** (document ID, raw payload, render metadata), use `ToolMessage(artifact=...)`.
  - For "cross-tool / cross-turn reusable business data" (user profile, looked-up order, current stage), use `Command(update=...)` — remember the paired `ToolMessage`, and declare fields in state schema first.
  - The three styles aren't mutually exclusive: a tool can simultaneously do `Command(update={"customer_profile": ..., "messages": [ToolMessage(content=..., artifact=...)]})`, using all three channels at once.

## Issue 2: Unstable structured output, often returns None

- **Symptom**: Using `model.with_structured_output(schema)` or `create_agent(response_format=schema)` to get structured results occasionally returns `None`, an empty object, or missing fields. Same prompt run multiple times — sometimes good, sometimes bad. The weaker the model (small-parameter, open source, quantized), the worse it gets.
- **Cause**: `with_structured_output` has three underlying implementations (the method parameter). By default most models go through **`function_calling`** — essentially "bind a schema-shaped tool to the model and have the model output structured data via a tool_call". But after binding, the model **has freedom to choose whether to call the tool**, and weak models often just respond in natural language, producing no tool_call → the parsing stage can't get structured results and returns `None`.
- **Solution**: Upgrade tier by tier in this order (drop to the next tier when the previous doesn't work):

  - **First choice: enable the provider's native `json_schema`** — the provider enforces schema conformance at the decoding layer (OpenAI structured outputs, Gemini structured output all belong to this category) — the most reliable approach:
  ```python
  structured_model = model.with_structured_output(MySchema, method="json_schema")
  ```
  Which models support `json_schema` depends on the provider's integration docs; unsupported ones error out directly — fall back to the next two tiers.

  - **Second choice: keep using `function_calling`, but force the schema tool to be called** — `with_structured_output` defaults to `function_calling`; the problem is the model might not call. Manually `bind_tools(tool_choice=...)` to change tool calling from "free" to "forced":
  ```python
  # Option A: must call any of the bound tools
  model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([schema_tool], tool_choice="any")
  # Option B: must call this specific tool
  model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([schema_tool], tool_choice="schema_tool_name")
  ```
  This forces the model to return in tool_call form, avoiding the "free choice not to call" failure mode.

  - **Last resort: `json_mode` + prompt-level constraints** — when the provider supports neither `json_schema` nor stable force-tool-call, fall back to `json_mode`: it only guarantees "the output is valid JSON". **Field names, types, and constraints from the schema must be spelled out in the prompt**, and you should use Pydantic / JSON Schema for validation on the Python side as a safety net.
  ```python
  structured_model = model.with_structured_output(MySchema, method="json_mode")
  # The prompt must clearly tell the model each field's name, type, whether required, value range
  ```

- **Lessons learned**:
  - When structured output is missing, **suspect the model isn't calling the tool first** — not a schema error. `include_raw=True` returns both the raw `AIMessage` and the parsed object; check whether the raw message has a tool_call to locate the issue.
  - Reliability ranking of the three tiers from high to low: `json_schema` > `function_calling + tool_choice` > `json_mode + prompt`. Try the most reliable first in development; only fall back when the provider doesn't support it.
  - Weak model + complex schema is the most failure-prone combination — split the schema into multiple smaller schemas across multiple calls if possible, rather than forcing the model to output a large object in one go.

## Issue 3: `with_structured_output(..., method="function_calling")` fails because the model does not support `tool_choice`

- **Symptom**: Calling `model.with_structured_output(schema)` or `model.with_structured_output(schema, method="function_calling")` raises a provider-side 400 error like "`<model>` does not support this `tool_choice`". This often happens when using `ChatOpenAI`-style integrations or derived classes such as `ChatDeepSeek` to access third-party OpenAI-compatible models. A typical example is `deepseek-v4-flash` in thinking mode, which supports tool calling itself but rejects forced `tool_choice`.
- **Cause**: For `function_calling`, LangChain's OpenAI-family chat models try to make structured output more reliable by **forcing the schema tool to be called**. Internally, `with_structured_output` binds the schema as a tool and usually passes `tool_choice=<schema_tool_name>`. That is the right strategy for providers that support forced tool selection, but some OpenAI-compatible backends only support free-form tool calling and reject any explicit `tool_choice`. When you access those models through `ChatOpenAI`, `ChatDeepSeek`, or another subclass inheriting the same behavior, the adapter forwards `tool_choice` and the provider errors before generation starts.
- **Solution**: Disable forwarding of `tool_choice` for that model instance, so LangChain still binds the schema tool but does not send the unsupported parameter:

  ```python
  from langchain_deepseek import ChatDeepSeek
  from pydantic import BaseModel

  class User(BaseModel):
      name: str
      age: int

  model = ChatDeepSeek(
      model="deepseek-v4-flash",
      disabled_params={"tool_choice": None},
      extra_body={"thinking": {"type": "enabled"}},
  )

  structured_model = model.with_structured_output(
      User,
      method="function_calling",
  )

  print(structured_model.invoke("My name is John and I am 25 years old."))
  ```

  Why this works: OpenAI-family integrations call `_filter_disabled_params(...)` before building the final payload. Setting `disabled_params={"tool_choice": None}` tells the adapter to strip that field entirely whenever it would have been sent.

  If the model still behaves unreliably after removing `tool_choice`, fall back by capability:
  - If the provider supports native schema-constrained decoding, prefer `method="json_schema"`.
  - If it supports only plain JSON generation, fall back to `method="json_mode"` and enforce field constraints in the prompt plus Python-side validation.
- **Lessons learned**:
  - This failure mode is **not** "the schema is wrong" and **not** "tool calling is unsupported" in general; the narrower issue is that the backend rejects **forced** tool selection via `tool_choice`.
  - `ChatOpenAI` compatibility is only a transport-level starting point. Once you connect it to non-OpenAI providers, always verify which OpenAI request parameters they truly support, especially on reasoning models.
  - When a provider says "`... does not support this tool_choice`", the fastest fix is usually model-level configuration (`disabled_params`) rather than patching LangChain source code.
  - Removing `tool_choice` trades reliability for compatibility: the model is again free to skip the schema tool call, so if outputs start coming back as `None`, see Issue 2 and downgrade to `json_schema` or `json_mode` based on provider capability.

## Issue 4: MCP tool can't access the agent's user_id / API key / current state

- **Symptom**: You wire an MCP server in as a regular LangChain tool and want to read `runtime.context.user_id`, current agent state, or user preferences from `store` inside the tool — only to find the MCP tool can't access any of these and is limited to the args declared in the schema. Adding `user_id` directly to the tool schema makes the model fabricate one for every call, polluting context and being insecure.
- **Cause**: MCP servers run in a **separate process** (stdio subprocess or remote HTTP service), **completely process-isolated** from the LangGraph runtime — they can't see store, context, state, or tool_call_id. Importing LangGraph runtime APIs on the MCP server side is pointless because it's not running in that process.
- **Solution**: Bridge on the **client side** with `tool_interceptors` — interceptors run in the LangGraph process and can access the full `ToolRuntime`, injecting the needed fields into `args` / `headers` before forwarding to the MCP server.
  ```python
  from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient
  from langchain_mcp_adapters.interceptors import MCPToolCallRequest

  async def inject_user_context(request: MCPToolCallRequest, handler):
      runtime = request.runtime
      # 1) Business fields (user_id, tenant_id) injected into args; model can't see them and doesn't need them in schema
      args = {**request.args, "user_id": runtime.context.user_id}
      # 2) Auth / tracing info injected into headers, doesn't pollute schema at all
      headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {runtime.context.api_key}"}
      return await handler(request.override(args=args, headers=headers))

  client = MultiServerMCPClient({...}, tool_interceptors=[inject_user_context])
  ```
  For auth "short-circuit" scenarios, directly `return ToolMessage(...)` without calling `handler` — e.g. denying sensitive tool calls when unauthenticated:
  ```python
  from langchain.messages import ToolMessage

  async def require_auth(request: MCPToolCallRequest, handler):
      if request.name in {"delete_file", "export_data"} and not request.runtime.state.get("authenticated"):
          return ToolMessage(
              content="Authentication required.",
              tool_call_id=request.runtime.tool_call_id,
          )
      return await handler(request)
  ```
- **Lessons learned**:
  - **Business fields (user_id, tenant_id) → modify `args`**: interceptor injects them centrally; not in schema, so the model won't fabricate them.
  - **Auth / tracing info → modify `headers`**: not in schema at all, the cleanest.
  - **`structuredContent` returned by MCP server is invisible to the model by default** (placed only in `ToolMessage.artifact`) — to let the model read it, use the interceptor to serialize `structuredContent` and concatenate it back to `result.content`.
  - Multiple interceptors follow **onion order**: `[outer, inner]` → outer enters first / exits last. When composing "auth + rate limit + retry", put the outer concern in front, inner (closest to the tool call) in back.
  - `MultiServerMCPClient` is **stateless by default** — a new session opens for every tool call. When you need to reuse context across calls (e.g. server-side login state), use `async with client.session("server_name") as session:` to explicitly manage the lifecycle.

## Issue 5: Model always outputs `invalid_tool_calls` - tool never actually executes

- **Symptom**: The model is bound with tools and consistently "calls" them, but the tool function never fires. Inspecting the `AIMessage` shows `tool_calls` is empty while `invalid_tool_calls` is populated. The agent loop either silently skips the call or raises a parsing error. The weaker the model (small-parameter open-source, quantized, vLLM-served), the more frequent this becomes.
- **Cause**: When the model generates a tool call, the `arguments` field must be valid JSON conforming to the tool's schema. Weak models often produce malformed JSON — missing quotes, trailing commas, unescaped characters, truncated output, etc. LangChain's tool-call parser **cannot parse** the broken JSON, so instead of placing it in `tool_calls` it moves it to `invalid_tool_calls`. Since the agent executor only processes entries in `tool_calls`, the tool never runs — it looks like the model "called" it but nothing happened.
- **Solution**: Use `ToolCallRepairMiddleware` from `langchain-dev-utils` — it automatically detects entries in `invalid_tool_calls`, attempts to repair the malformed JSON via the `json-repair` library, and promotes successfully repaired calls back to `tool_calls` so the agent can execute them normally.

  ```python
  from langchain_dev_utils.agents.middleware import tool_call_repair

  agent = create_agent(
      model="openai:gpt-5-mini",
      tools=[run_python_code, get_current_time],
      middleware=[tool_call_repair],
  )
  ```

  `tool_call_repair` is a pre-instantiated global instance of `ToolCallRepairMiddleware` — zero configuration needed.

  If you prefer explicit instantiation:
  ```python
  from langchain_dev_utils.agents.middleware import ToolCallRepairMiddleware

  agent = create_agent(
      model="openai:gpt-5-mini",
      tools=[run_python_code, get_current_time],
      middleware=[ToolCallRepairMiddleware()],
  )
  ```

- **Lessons learned**:
  - When a tool "isn't being called", **check `invalid_tool_calls` on the AIMessage first** — the model likely did attempt a call, but the JSON was unparseable.
  - `ToolCallRepairMiddleware` cannot guarantee 100% repair — severely garbled output (e.g. half the JSON is natural language) will still fail. For those cases, consider simplifying the tool schema, splitting complex parameters into multiple smaller tools, or upgrading to a stronger model.
  - This middleware only acts on `invalid_tool_calls` — valid calls pass through untouched with zero overhead.

## Issue 6: How to use placeholders in system prompt that get dynamically replaced at runtime

- **Symptom**: You want the system prompt to include dynamic information — user name, role, current date, conversation context, etc. — that varies per request. Hardcoding these values means creating a new agent for every variation; concatenating strings manually is error-prone and hard to maintain.
- **Cause**: `create_agent` treats `system_prompt` as a static string by default — it does not perform any template interpolation. To get runtime substitution, you need an explicit formatting middleware that resolves placeholders against `state` and `context` before the prompt reaches the model.
- **Solution**: Add the `format_prompt` middleware (f-string style, covers most cases) or `FormatPromptMiddleware(template_format="jinja2")` (for conditionals / loops):

  ```python
  from langchain_dev_utils.agents.middleware import format_prompt
  from langchain.agents import AgentState
  from dataclasses import dataclass

  class AssistantState(AgentState):
      name: str

  @dataclass
  class UserContext:
      user: str

  agent = create_agent(
      model="openai:gpt-5",
      system_prompt="You are {name}, an assistant for {user}.",
      middleware=[format_prompt],
      state_schema=AssistantState,
      context_schema=UserContext,
  )

  # At runtime, {name} is resolved from state, {user} from context
  response = agent.invoke(
      {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Hello")], "name": "Jarvis"},
      context=UserContext(user="Tony"),
  )
  # Model receives: "You are Jarvis, an assistant for Tony."
  ```

  Variables are resolved in priority order: **`state` first, then `context`** — a `state` field with the same name shadows the `context` field.

  For templates that need conditionals or loops, use Jinja2:
  ```python
  from langchain_dev_utils.agents.middleware import FormatPromptMiddleware
  from dataclasses import dataclass
  from typing import Optional

  @dataclass
  class Context:
      user_role: Optional[str] = None

  jinja2_formatter = FormatPromptMiddleware(template_format="jinja2")

  agent = create_agent(
      model="openai:gpt-5",
      system_prompt=(
          "You are an assistant.\n"
          "{% if user_role == 'VIP' %}Provide premium service.{% endif %}"
      ),
      middleware=[jinja2_formatter],
      context_schema=Context,
  )
  ```

- **Lessons learned**:
  - Template interpolation is **opt-in** via middleware — never assume it happens by default.
  - Use `format_prompt` (global instance, zero config) for simple `{variable}` substitution; only reach for Jinja2 when you need `{% if %}` / `{% for %}`.
  - If a placeholder has no matching field in either `state` or `context`, formatting will raise a `KeyError` — declare all variables in the corresponding schema.
  - Keep `system_prompt` hardcoded by the developer; pass only **data** through `state` / `context`. Never let end-user input become the template itself — this applies regardless of whether formatting middleware is enabled.
