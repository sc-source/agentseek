"""Bub plugin that mounts the AgentSeek CLI surface onto the main framework app.

When the main ``agentseek`` package's CLI bootstraps Bub and loads plugins,
``register_cli_commands`` is called with the root Typer app. We attach every
top-level group from :func:`agentseek_cli.app.iter_command_groups`.

Names listed in :data:`CLI_OVERRIDE_NAMES` will **replace** any same-named
command already registered by the framework (e.g. Bub's built-in ``run``
which dispatches a single message is replaced by the CLI's ``run`` which
starts project services locally).

Other groups skip registration if the name is already present (idempotent).

Commands are organized into rich_help_panel groups so ``--help`` shows a
categorized view instead of a flat list.
